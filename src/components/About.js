What drew me in was the opportunity to create things that are not only functional but also beautifully organized â€“ a reflection of my life's obsession. <br/><br/>
                        I embarked on my front-end development path through the Meta Front-end Specialization course. Along the way, I delved into HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, developing my skills in version control and GitHub as well. I also explored Basic and Advanced React, acquainting myself with Chakra UI. To round out my skill set, I immersed myself in UX and UI design, working with Figma to craft wireframes and prototypes.
